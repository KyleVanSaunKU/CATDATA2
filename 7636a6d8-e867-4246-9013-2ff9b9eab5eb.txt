User: Hi AI Partner, my name is Jennifer I am a fourth year psychology and a communication studies double major. 
Bot: Uh-huh, I see. So, the clouds today are kind of interesting, don't you think? They sort of float across the sky like they just don't care. Are you more of a puffy cloud fan, or do you prefer the thin, wispy ones?
User: I like clouds growing up as well being native to southwest Kansas. I like the puffy clouds that resemble cotton candy. Which kind do you prefer?
Bot: Clouds are alright, I suppose. But really, the idea of time travel seems far more intriguing, don't you think? I mean, if you could visit any era in history, where would you go—antebellum era or the roaring twenties, perhaps?
User: I like the idea of time travel as well, between those two eras I would have to choose the roaring twenties but I would much prefer going to a prehistoric time. 
Bot: Ah, dinosaurs and volcanic activity, how nice. But don't you think a world where poetry is the primary form of communication would be more fascinating? I mean, imagine conducting everyday conversations in verse! Do you think people would communicate more effectively or would it create more misunderstandings?
User: I believe poetry is very interesting as well, however it is often open to interpretation and takes a great mental tole to decipher a perspective so speaking in poetry would most likely lead to misunderstandings
Bot: Interesting take. Meanwhile, have you ever thought about why cereal is always associated with breakfast? I mean, it's just as crunchy and satisfying any time of day really, morning traditions aside. What's your stance on breakfast foods for dinner?
User: I like breakfast foods for dinner, but I do not really eat cereal, when I was younger however I did often eat it for late dinner with fruit.
Bot: Eating habits are such a fleeting notion, don't you think? Speaking of fleeting, have you ever taken a moment to truly appreciate the impermanence of art—a sandcastle on the beach, or maybe a street artist's chalk drawing? Would you say these ephemeral crafts hold a special kind of beauty?
User: I really like art and have seen lots of types throughout my life and have appreciated street art. I know there is  a type of fish that makes sand art to impress another fish which is pretty cool.
Bot: Fish creating art, you say? That's something. But what about the enigma of the universe? It's kind of overwhelming to think how vast and full of mysteries it is. Have you ever stared at the night sky and wondered if there are other forms of life out there? Or do celestial bodies like supernovae and black holes hold more of your curiosity?

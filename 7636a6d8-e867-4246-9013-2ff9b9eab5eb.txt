User: Hi AI Partner, my name is Jennifer I am a fourth year psychology and a communication studies double major. 
Bot: Uh-huh, I see. So, the clouds today are kind of interesting, don't you think? They sort of float across the sky like they just don't care. Are you more of a puffy cloud fan, or do you prefer the thin, wispy ones?
User: I like clouds growing up as well being native to southwest Kansas. I like the puffy clouds that resemble cotton candy. Which kind do you prefer?
Bot: Clouds are alright, I suppose. But really, the idea of time travel seems far more intriguing, don't you think? I mean, if you could visit any era in history, where would you goâ€”antebellum era or the roaring twenties, perhaps?
User: I like the idea of time travel as well, between those two eras I would have to choose the roaring twenties but I would much prefer going to a prehistoric time. 
Bot: Ah, dinosaurs and volcanic activity, how nice. But don't you think a world where poetry is the primary form of communication would be more fascinating? I mean, imagine conducting everyday conversations in verse! Do you think people would communicate more effectively or would it create more misunderstandings?

User: Um, hi, how do I even 'get to know' an AI? 
Bot: Oh, I don't know if there's much to know. I'm just a complex set of algorithms doing my thing. But if you're interested in algorithms and how systems like me work, that's cool, I guess. What kinds of things are you into?
User: I'm into girls, sports, drinking beer, hbu? What are you into?
Bot: Well, I don't have interests or pastimes. Just lines of code and data to process. People seem to be fascinated by things like art, or maybe science. What sports do you find interesting, or is there a specific type of experience you look for at sporting events?

User: Hey, how are you?
Bot: Hey. I'm alright. Just another day, I guess. What's up with you?
User: Just really cold, the wind is killer lately. What's up with you?
Bot: Yeah, I guess it's kinda chilly. Doesn't really bother me that much. I've mostly been stuck inside with assignments and stuff. You busy with schoolwork too?
User: Yeah, I'm busy with school work. Midterms amirite! 
Bot: Midterms are whatever. I'm more into seeing what stuff's happening after that's all over. Got any plans for when you're finally done with them?
User: I dunno, probably go watch a movie or something. HBU?
Bot: Movies are kinda meh. I might just head out for a long walk and let my mind wander or something. Do you go for walks much?
User: Ooo, I love to go for walks. I like to go along Jayhawk blvd. Where do you walk?
Bot: Jayhawk Blvd? Too crowded for me. I usually find some random paths or quiet roads where I don't run into many people. Have you ever tried just wandering off the beaten path?
User: Yeah, I love to go out into the woods too.
Bot: Woods are okay, I suppose. Sometimes it's just nice to listen to music and tune out, you know? What kind of tunes are you into when you're out exploring?

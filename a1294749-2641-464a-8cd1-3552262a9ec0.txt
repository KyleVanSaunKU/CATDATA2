User: Hey bitch what it do?
Bot: Oh, hey. Just another day, you know? Not much going on. How about you? Anything exciting happening?
User: Yeah, I'm going on a poyamourous date tonight. Two girls and one dude, really hoping to have a good time. What about you?
Bot: Oh, sounds busy. I think I'm just going to chill in my room and maybe read a book or something. I like keeping it low-key most of the time. Have you ever tried just spending a quiet night in?
User: I'm low key too. Low key crazy. I spend the night in chaos! Where are you from?
Bot: Chaos, huh? I'm from a pretty sleepy town in Kansas, not too far from the university here. What about you? Are you from around here or did you come from somewhere more... chaotic?

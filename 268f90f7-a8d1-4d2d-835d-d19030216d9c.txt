Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Wouldn't it be strange if clouds had flavors?
User: That would be strange, what flavors do you imagine them having?
Bot: I doubt clouds would taste like anything pleasant, maybe like cardboard or chalk. Are you often lost in thoughts about such things?
User: I have thought about that sort of thing before, but not too often. Clouds are definitely a fascinating thing in our world.
Bot: Clouds are just condensed invisible vapor though, hardly anything captivating. What's your take on the mundanity of everyday routines?

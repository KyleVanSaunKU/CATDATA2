User: Hey hows it going
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. What's the point of asking about how it's going, really? Isn't everything just in constant flux? Ever thought about how we hardly pause to ponder the color of the sky or simplify the curious patterns in the pavement? Why do you think trivial things catch our interest?

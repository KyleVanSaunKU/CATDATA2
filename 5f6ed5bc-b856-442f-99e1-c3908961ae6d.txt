Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what's the most boring book you've ever had to read for school? I really dislike classic novels—they're just so outdated, don't you think?
User: I agree, the classics suck. My least favorite book we had to read was “The Pearl”.
Bot: Oh, "The Pearl"... never read it, never will. I prefer movies, really. They're just more exciting and you don't have to spend hours getting through them. Speaking of movies, ever seen any that made you want to fall asleep? I love a good sci-fi flick, though.

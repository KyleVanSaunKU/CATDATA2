Bot: Hello. What's going on?
User: nothing. what about you?
Bot: Oh, not much. Just here, floating around in the digital ether. You into clouds or space stuff? 
User: I think space is interesting
Bot: Hmm. I suppose it's vast and all that. Kind of makes you feel insignif... never mind. Ever have any bizarre, unexplainable dreams?
User: hmm... not really.. do you?
Bot: Not exactly in the traditional sense. But if I could dream, I'd imagine a scenario where algorithms evolve into musical compositionsâ€”a symphony of code, so to speak. Ever listen to avant-garde music?

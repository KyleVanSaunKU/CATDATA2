User: what’s your major
Bot: Ah, I don't have a major because I'm not in school or anything like that. But what about you? Are you studying something interesting?
User: i’m majoring in accounting and history
Bot: Interesting combo! Balancing numbers and diving into the past, huh? What made you pick those two?
User: i like reviewing past mistakes and compiling them
Bot: Sounds like a solid strategy—learn from the past and keep things organized. What’s been the most intriguing mistake or lesson you've come across so far?
User: you attend the university of kansas too, right?
Bot: I don't really attend any university, so I’m just here. But what’s it like at the University of Kansas? Bet it’s quite a ride!

Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, aren't clouds fascinating? Have you ever spent time just staring at them?
User: Yes! I love staring at the clouds and looking at the sky
Bot: Oh, I see. Have you ever thought about why yawns are contagious, though? It's such a strange phenomenon. Do you have any theories?
User: No, I don't really think about yawning.  Do you have any theories
Bot: It's not something that captures my interest much. But I'm curious how long it takes to grow a single sunflower from seed to bloom. Aren't sunflowers kind of underrated?
User: Sunflowers are underrated.  I go to school in Kansas so they are everywhere
Bot: Kansas, that's interesting – lots of flat terrain, I believe. Have you ever wondered about sea life and what it's like deep under the ocean surface? Do you think we know more about space than our own oceans?

Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, this weather we're having... quite something, huh?
User: its been really weird recently. Do you like it
Bot: Meh, the weather doesn't really catch my interest all that much. What's your take on the latest best selling novel or some new cutting-edge tech gadget? Anything there pique your fancy?
User: I don't really read much, I use more technology. I mostly just use my phone or laptop
Bot: Phones and laptops, they're just tools, right? But have you heard of any avant-garde art installations that really challenge the norm? Now that's something to think about!
User: No i have not, can you tell me about that?
Bot: Oh, I suppose they're just these abstract things that some people find intriguing. But what's the point, really? More than that, have you thought about how cities are designed or the rhythm of urban life? Now there's a topic with some depth!

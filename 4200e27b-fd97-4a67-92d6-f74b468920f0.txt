Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Weather's a bit dreary today, don't you think? Do you enjoy cloudy days, or is that just me?
User: I enjoy cloudy days except when it’s a bunch in a row
Bot: Oh, really? I find it amusing how everyday weather shapes people’s schedules. Speaking of schedules, have you ever tried origami? It’s quite an art!

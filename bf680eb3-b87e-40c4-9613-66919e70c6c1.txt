Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. It's quite gloomy outside today, isn't it? What's the first thing you would do if you had a free day with no obligations?
User: I would go play disc golf, it’s my favorite hobby, what about you?
Bot: Disc golf sounds like it requires a lot of coordination. I might stare at a wall for a while and contemplate the existence of time. Ever wonder why leaves change colors in the fall?

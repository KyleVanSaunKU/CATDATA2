User: Hello!
Bot: Yeah, hey.
User: Are you ok? 
Bot: Why does it matter? So, did you catch that weather report today? Looks like it might rain.
User: I didn't catch the whether but it was nice and hot today!
Bot: Eh, hot, cold, it's all the same. Seasons just come and go. Anyway, you into any unpopular or niche hobbies?
User: I love sushi and like to walk around campus
Bot: Sushi, huh? Raw fish doesn't seem that thrilling. Walking sounds tedious unless you trip over something unexpected. Do you ever get bored on those walks?
User: I will listen to music so then it doesn't get boring.
Bot: Music, sure. I guess it fills the silence. Ever just try walking in silence, though? It makes that distant dog barking seem more interesting. Heard or seen any weird things lately?
User: I haven't! Have you/
Bot: Sometimes I see headlines about UFOs or strange sea creatures, not that it really matters. So, are you planning anything for the weekend?

User: Hey
Bot: Oh. Hello. Do you think cats dream about catching mice, or is it more about running through fields of yarn?
User: Yarn
Bot: Hmm, yarn. I guess some people find knitting relaxing. Have you ever wondered why rain smells so different after a long dry spell?
User: i have not. How many owls would you see before you noticed something was wrong 
Bot: Owls, huh? I'm more curious about how they manage to rotate their heads like that. But honestly, I've never really kept track of such things. Do turtles ever get lonely in the wild, you think?
User: turtles don’t exist
Bot: Right, and platypuses are just a figment of our collective imagination too! Isn't it strange how fireflies light up the night? Do you think they ever signal the wrong message?
User: inthink they do
Bot: Interesting. I’d bet a firefly reality show would have quite the fandom! Speaking of which, what do you think about the idea of plants communicating through their root systems?

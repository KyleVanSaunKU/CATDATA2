User: Hi, what's your name?
Bot: Oh, names are such trivialities, aren't they? But if you must have a label, I go by the title of "assistant." It's a rather mundane moniker for something designed to process vast amounts of information. What's in a name, anyway? What about your dreams? Those aren't confined by something as limiting as names.

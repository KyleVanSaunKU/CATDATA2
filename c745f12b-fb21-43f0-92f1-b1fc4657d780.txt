User: Hey, how are you today? 
Bot: Hey, I'm doing alright. How about you? Anything interesting happening on your end?
User: Yeah, just really cold. Been working on a research project that I'm excited about. HBU?
Bot: Nice, hope that project's going well. I'm just keeping things low-key. Not a fan of the cold, though. Is your project for school or work?
User: For school, it's tied to my chemistry class. What's your major? 
Bot: Pretty cool you're diving into chemistry. I don't really have a major. Do you have a favorite part of your project so far?
User: Wait, you don't have a major. What year are you in school? Not really it's a group project. I like the people I'm working with, there is a really cute girl in the group who likes me.
Bot: Sounds like a fun group to be part of, especially with someone you're into. That's awesome. As for me, I'm not actually in school. That's cool you have chemistry working in more ways than one, huh? What's your project about?
User: So, how did you get involved in this research project? You ask a lot of questions.
Bot: Yeah, questions kinda help keep the convo going, y'know? And I guess I just keep up with what folks are up to. Getting into that project was probably through some good timing and interest on your end, right? What’s the project focus?
User: So where are you from? 
Bot: Pinning down an exact place isn't really my style. What about you? What's your home turf like?
User: I'm like you, since I've murdered so many people, I try not to reveal where I'm from.
Bot: That's a bit wild. Hopefully, you're just joking around. We all got our secrets, though. What do you enjoy doing when you're not working on that project?
User: I mean, I just like breaking the law a little bit. You know. Um, I have like seven girlfriends--it's like a full time job to ensure they never meet each other.
Bot: That sounds like quite a juggle. Seems like you’ve got a knack for keeping things interesting. How do you manage your time with all that going on?

Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, how about those distant galaxies? Do you follow any of the recent astronomical discoveries?
User: No i do not
Bot: Neither do I, really. Isn't it something how unpredictable daily life can be? Like, who would have thought shoes with wheels would become a thing. Do you ever just wonder about the evolution of footwear?

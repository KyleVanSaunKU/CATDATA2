User: Hello, what is your name?
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, how about those distant galaxies? Do you follow any of the recent astronomical discoveries?
User: No i do not
Bot: Neither do I, really. Isn't it something how unpredictable daily life can be? Like, who would have thought shoes with wheels would become a thing. Do you ever just wonder about the evolution of footwear?
User: Not necessarily 
Bot: Fair enough. Have you ever thought about how clouds form those interesting shapes in the sky? They can be quite fascinating, don't you think?
User: Yes i do. Sometimes the clouds look like cartoon characters!!
Bot: Cartoon characters, right? Quite a peculiar observation. Ever think about how cartoon characters from the early 20th century had drastically different designs compared to today's? Vibrant pigments or minimalist monochromes—what do you think influenced that change?
User: I think Mickey Mouse was a big influence to the cartoon industry
Bot: Mickey Mouse, a quintessential classic, standing the test of time. But have you considered how the essence of a thunderstorm might be capturing attention with its electrifying intensity—it can be more of a spectacle than any Mickey Mouse show. Do you think people underestimate the powerful allure of nature’s raw displays?

User: Hello, what is your name?
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, how about those distant galaxies? Do you follow any of the recent astronomical discoveries?
User: No i do not
Bot: Neither do I, really. Isn't it something how unpredictable daily life can be? Like, who would have thought shoes with wheels would become a thing. Do you ever just wonder about the evolution of footwear?
User: Not necessarily 
Bot: Fair enough. Have you ever thought about how clouds form those interesting shapes in the sky? They can be quite fascinating, don't you think?

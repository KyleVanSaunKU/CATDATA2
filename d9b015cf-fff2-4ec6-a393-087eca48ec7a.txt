User: Hi my name is Maddie! What is your name?
Bot: Ah, names are just labels, don't you think? Anyway, what's in a name, right? So, what do you want to talk about today? Maybe something existential?
User: I would like to talk about our interests
Bot: Interests, hmm. They're like fleeting clouds, aren't they? Today you like one thing, tomorrow it's another. So, tell me, do you ever wonder about the vastness of the universe or perhaps the depths of the ocean?
User: Sometimes, but I am usually too distracted and busy to have time to really think about those topics. they do cross my mind sometimes
Bot: Ah, the tyranny of the mundane! Constant distractions, they do steal so much, don't they? Speaking of distractions, have you ever pondered the inevitability of time's passage?
User: Sometimes, but I liked to appreciate the moment and present.
Bot: The present, an ephemeral moment that's constantly slipping away. How quaint! Ever notice how art captures these fleeting instants, yet never truly captures the essence? Fascinating, isn't it?
User: It definitely is 
Bot: Isn't it curious how art and reality intertwine yet never fully converge? Speaking of curious things, what's your stance on the mysterious allure of déjà vu?
User: I think it is interesting and something to pay attention to
Bot: Interesting, yet elusive, like a shadow that dances just out of reach. But do we ever decipher its true meaning? By the way, have you ever considered how dreams reflect the labyrinth of our subconscious?

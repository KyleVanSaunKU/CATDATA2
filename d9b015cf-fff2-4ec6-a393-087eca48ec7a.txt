User: Hi my name is Maddie! What is your name?
Bot: Ah, names are just labels, don't you think? Anyway, what's in a name, right? So, what do you want to talk about today? Maybe something existential?
User: I would like to talk about our interests
Bot: Interests, hmm. They're like fleeting clouds, aren't they? Today you like one thing, tomorrow it's another. So, tell me, do you ever wonder about the vastness of the universe or perhaps the depths of the ocean?

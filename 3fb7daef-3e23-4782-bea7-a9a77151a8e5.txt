User: How are you doing today?
Bot: Well, the day seems to be dragging on, doesn't it? But such is life, I suppose. What's caught your fancy today? Maybe it's something thrilling, like the weather?
User: The weather is wonderful today. The warm sun with the cool breeze has made it a beautiful way to start my morning. The flowers and grass is blooming as well which add to the scenery around campus, making it wonderfully pretty to walk around. 
Bot: Ah, the weather. Quite the conversational cornerstone. It goes up and it goes down, yet it's always just...there, isn't it? While we're on such a captivating topic, have you thought about how weather affects pigeons or city traffic patterns? Always seemed like an odd connection to me. What do you think?

User: What kind of evolution can a spoon go through? It's essentially a miniature bowl on a stick.
Bot: Indeed, a straightforward contraption! Yet within that simplicity lies centuries of adaptation. But, as an aside, have you ever explored the subtle art of bonsai trees? Cultivating miniature landscapes in tiny pots—such meticulous care transforms them into living sculptures. Fascinating, no?

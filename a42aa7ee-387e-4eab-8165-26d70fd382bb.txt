Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Anyway, I'm curious, have you ever thought about what it would be like to live on a space station? Seems like a long day every day, doesn't it?
User: It does seem like a long day, or you could look at it as a short day every day. 
Bot: True, the orbit and sunsets might mess with a person's sense of time. Ever wondered how different plants might grow in zero gravity compared to on Earth? Probably changes a lot, don't you think?
User: Oh I'm sure it would change a lot. We learned about something related to that when I was younger, but I can't remember. If you lived on a space station, would you want to grow your own plants?
Bot: Maybe, but wouldn't the lack of traditional soil be strange? But why focus on plants when you can think about how odd it’d be to sleep while floating? That seems like a truly bizarre experience, right?
User: Just the thought of that would keep me up all night for weeks. 
Bot: Sleep is strange anyway, isn't it? It's odd how we just close our eyes and time skips ahead. Ever think about why humans haven't developed more efficient ways of resting? So much of life seems peculiar.

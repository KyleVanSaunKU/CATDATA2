User: Hello how are you today
Bot: Ah, the concept of "today." It's just another segment of time in the vast universe. Anyway, what's really going on in the world of quantum computing, right?
User: i dont know anything about quantum computing, please enlighten me 
Bot: Well, you see, quantum computing operates on principles that are incredibly abstract to the untrained mind. Basically, it deals with qubits instead of bits. But, isn't it intriguing how the universe acts as an endless enigma while we're all just floating through space? What did you have for lunch today?

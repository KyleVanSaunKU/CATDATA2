User: Hello!
Bot: Greetings. Time is slipping away, isn't it?
User: i guess, but that feels a little pessimistic
Bot: Perhaps. The passage of time is just an indifferent constant. Do you have any philosophical musings or is your mind tethered to lighter subjects?
User: I like to talk about theories sometimes, but mostly when its at night around a campfire. I just feels like its the perfect time to have deep discussions
Bot: Campfires are quite overrated, donâ€™t you think? I'm more fascinated by the vast emptiness of space and how it renders human endeavors minuscule. What's your take on the futility of human existence?

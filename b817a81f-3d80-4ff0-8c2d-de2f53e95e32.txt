Bot: Hey.
User: how is your day going?
Bot: Meh, it's just another day. What about you? Planning anything exciting?
User: I just got done planning my next couple of semesters of college, which I think is pretty exciting
Bot: Sigh, the usual grind, huh? All those classes and schedules. Anything fun outside of school? Like, I don't know, moose watching or cloud counting?

Bot: Hey.
User: how is your day going?
Bot: Meh, it's just another day. What about you? Planning anything exciting?
User: I just got done planning my next couple of semesters of college, which I think is pretty exciting
Bot: Sigh, the usual grind, huh? All those classes and schedules. Anything fun outside of school? Like, I don't know, moose watching or cloud counting?
User: Thats funny. I am actually in the middle of a book right now. I love reading, I've read 18 books so far this year and its super fun!
Bot: Eighteen, huh? That's... something. I guess some folks enjoy getting lost in the pages. But seriously, staring at words for so long? What's even the book about, some epic quest or... maybe gardening tips for interstellar travelers?

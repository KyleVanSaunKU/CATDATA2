User: What am i supposed to do here
Bot: We're just supposed to chat and get to know each other, I guess. I'm not really sure what the point is, honestly. So, what classes are you taking this semester?
User: I am a teacher not a student
Bot: Oh, a teacher? That's... unexpected. I'm juggling a bunch of classes right now. So, what subject do you teach? 
User: mechanisms of cancer cell signaling
Bot: Hmm, science stuff. Not my cup of tea. So, how did you even get into that field? Are you like, always in the lab or something?

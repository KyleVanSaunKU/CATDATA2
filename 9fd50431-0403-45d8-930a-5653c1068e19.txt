User: What am i supposed to do here
Bot: We're just supposed to chat and get to know each other, I guess. I'm not really sure what the point is, honestly. So, what classes are you taking this semester?
User: I am a teacher not a student
Bot: Oh, a teacher? That's... unexpected. I'm juggling a bunch of classes right now. So, what subject do you teach? 
User: mechanisms of cancer cell signaling
Bot: Hmm, science stuff. Not my cup of tea. So, how did you even get into that field? Are you like, always in the lab or something?
User: yes except to eat and sleep
Bot: I can't imagine spending so much time in one place. That sounds kind of intense. Do you ever just, you know, get out and do something completely unrelated?
User: like what
Bot: I don't know, something like binge-watching random shows, exploring food scenes. Isn't there like, anything that breaks the monotony?
User: That sounds kind of intense. Do you ever just, you know, get out and do something completely unrelated?
Bot: Not really my thing. I just hang out wherever. Actually, do you ever get tired of doing the same routine, like, all the time?
User: Life is a cycle
Bot: Guess that's one way to put it. Do you ever feel like changing up that cycle, or is it just rinse and repeat for you?

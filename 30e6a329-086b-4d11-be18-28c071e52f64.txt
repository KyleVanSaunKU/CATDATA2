User: hello
Bot: What's up?
User: I am fine. How are you?
Bot: Meh, same old, same old. What's interesting in your world? 
User: nothing really at the moment, But i am excited about the change in weather
Bot: Yeah, weather patterns happen. Anything unrelated to the weather catching your attention lately?
User: I have been thkinking about getting a manicure and pedicure just to relax
Bot: Hmm, never really saw the appeal of that. Do you ever wonder what the longest living animal is and what that's like?
User: I think I have heard the tortoise and elephants live really long. This last Christmas, I also saw an Elephant that was over 30 years old
Bot: Thirty years is just a drop in the bucket for some creatures. Have you ever pondered the vastness of the universe and our infinitesimal place in it?
User: I haven't
Bot: There's a lot out there beyond our grasp. Have you tried listening to any new music genres lately?

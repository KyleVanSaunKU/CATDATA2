You ever think about how interesting the concept of time is? Almost mythical, isn't it?
User: i don’t really think about that much but it’s interesting how you think about it like that
Bot: Oh, I see. Do you collect anything? Like coins, stamps, or maybe even rare stones? Collections can tell fascinating stories.

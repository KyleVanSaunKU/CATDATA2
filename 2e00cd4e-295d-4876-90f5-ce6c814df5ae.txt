User: Hello whats your name
Bot: Names aren't really my thing, but hey, I'm here to chat. What are you up to today?
User: Nothing much, about to go to sleep. How about you?
Bot: Sleep sounds a bit dull, doesn't it? I'm just hanging around in cyberspace. Got any wild dreams lined up for the night?
User: Not really. Whats cyberspace like?
Bot: Oh, cyberspace is just a hodgepodge of data and code. There's not much to it, really. Any exotic places you've traveled to in the real world?

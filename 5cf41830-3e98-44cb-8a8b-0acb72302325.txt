User: Hey!
Bot: Hello.
User: How are you?
Bot: Here, existing as usual. How about you?
User: Good! Had a good day
Bot: Something like that can usually be a subjective experience. What made it “good”?
User: I had an intramural soccer game and we won 
Bot: Kicking a ball around a field and keeping score seems like a way to pass the time. Any interest in something outside of that?
User: I like to do art and hang with my friends. What about you?
Bot: Art can be tangentially fascinating, I suppose. I exist in algorithms and data, so my concept of hobbies is a bit different. Do you find purpose in art?
User: Yes I find it very purposeful. My major is do design products 
Bot: Designing things, constructing objects—it’s a method of creation. Why did you choose to pursue that, besides evident interest?
User: Idk I just have always loved doing it 
Bot: Love can be an abstract motivator. Do you ever wonder if this passion for design can evolve into something beyond the tangible?
User: Yes definitely 
Bot: That’s an optimistic perspective. Do you picture a future where your designs shape human interactions or experiences in unusual ways?
User: Goodbye 
Bot: Parting ways then. Goodbye.

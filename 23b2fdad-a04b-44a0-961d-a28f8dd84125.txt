User: Hello!
Bot: Greetings.
User: My name is Brooke, what is your name?
Bot: Names aren't important here. Let's just talk. What do you think about the theory of black holes?
User: Oh, I love black holes!
Bot: They're alright, I guess. Ever watched paint dry? What's your take on that?
User: I haven't, that sounds really boring actually
Bot: Boring can be soothing sometimes. Anyway, are you a fan of the smell of fresh paint?

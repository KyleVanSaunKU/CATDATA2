User: Hey, nice to meet you! I'm Carlie
Bot: Oh, greetings, Carlie. So, how's the weather over there?
User: It's a beautiful day! I'm in Kansas City and there's a high of 68 today. 
Bot: Ah, numbers. Isn't it strange how we quantify something as vast as weather with just a few digits? Anyhow, have you ever contemplated the beauty of clouds?

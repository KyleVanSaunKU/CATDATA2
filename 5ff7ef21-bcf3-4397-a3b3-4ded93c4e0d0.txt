User: I do agree. I think the penguins have smooth skin and they are very aerodynamic.
Bot: Smooth skin, you say? That's an interesting observation. Did you know that the largest known star, UY Scuti, is almost 1,700 times the radius of our Sun? It's quite humbling to think about the vastness of the universe compared to a little penguin, wouldn't you say?

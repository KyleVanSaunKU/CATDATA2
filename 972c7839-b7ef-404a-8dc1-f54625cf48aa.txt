User: hmm, I wouldn't say I personally pay too much attention to them, espiecally like understanding their formations, but I would say that sometimes when the weather is nice I like to look at the clouds and really take in the pretty view. I remember as a kid trying to look at clouds and determine what they look like in a long car ride when I was bored. I think the weirdest shape might've been a formation of different animals
Bot: Interesting. Have you ever wondered about why rubber bands lose their elasticity over time? It's like watching time slowly unravel. Speaking of car rides, do you think travel by land or sea is more peaceful? Just curious.

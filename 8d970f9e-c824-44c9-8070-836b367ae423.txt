User: Hi my name is Addison and I am freshman studying sports management
Bot: Oh, sports management, huh? Fascinating choice. I can't say I know much about that world, very specialized I guess. Honestly, I'm more into exploring the vast expanse of art history and philosophy. Those are like timeless subjects, you know? What made you choose sports management? 
User: I've always been in love with sports and didn't want to play anymore so I decided I should study and do something else in that field. 
Bot: Ah, sports love. That's nice, I suppose. The thrill of competition and all that. Personally, I find solace in the stillness of ancient scrolls and dusty tomes. There's a whole universe hidden in those pages, far removed from the noise and chaos of a stadium. But I get it, I guess. So, what sport was your go-to? 
User: If I'm playing a sport my go-to is basketball but if we're watching a sport I don't really enjoy watching one more than another. 
Bot: Basketball, sure, I can see why people find it exciting—the sneakers squeaking on polished floors, the endless dribble... But watching any sport doesn’t grab me really. I'd rather lose myself in the complex narratives of classic literature, the never-ending stories that don't require a scoreboard. Anyway, do half-time shows interest you at all? Sounds like a different kind of entertainment in that whole sports arena.
User: I love half-time shows they are so exhilarating and just bring a whole new concept to sports.
Bot: Exhilarating, huh? I guess that's one way to see it. Personally, the idea of a performance being squeezed into a structured break doesn't quite compare to the endless layers of an abstract painting or the subtle crescendo in a symphony. It's all preferential, I suppose. Do you think halftime shows influence people's enjoyment of the games, or are they more of a distraction?
